      <p class="paragraph">The purpose of a toaster oven is to offer a more compact, versatile, and efficient alternative 
        to a regular oven, making it easier and more accessible for everyday use. Its key components are the two dials that 
        control heat and time, which are labeled with increasing intervals that fit each function. These toaster ovens are 
        typically found in homes and other living areas that may require a smaller substitute for large ovens, or are used 
        by people who enjoy the convenience of a small toaster oven. Note: I chose this interface because I mainly stay
         at home and we don't have many appliances and interfaces -- sorry!! :(</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Recorded Observations</h2>
      <p class="paragraphleft">I interviewed my parents in person so they could interact with the toaster oven, 
        and one friend over Zoom (I sent her pictures of the toaster and dials). I purposefully chose these people because 
        they represented a range of age, gender, and socioeconomic demographics. During these interviews, I noticed:
      </p>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>All users instinctively knew how to use the toaster oven. My parents use it everyday, but my friend 
          immediately knew how to set the time and heat dials, showing that comprehending these functions is universal</li>
        <li>Everyone focused more on the time dial instead of the heat dial, and all adjusted the dials approximately 
          instead of turning to exact values</li>
        <li>The people who typically only use the toaster oven for breakfast (my dad and friend) rarely touched the heat 
          dial and kept it on "low heat". In contrast, my mom uses the oven for all 3 meals of the day, and was more 
          comfortable with adjusting the heat settings</li>
        <li>Everyone enjoyed the practicality and simplicity of the toaster, but some wished for more complex functions
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h2">Questions & Interviews</h2>
      <p class="paragraphleft">Questions:</p>
      <ol class="lists">
        <li>When would you choose to use this toaster oven over another kitchen appliance, and for what purposes / types of cooking? 
        </li>
        <li>To what extent does its smaller size affect your reasons for using this appliance?</li>
        <li>Do you think pulling the lever to open the toaster oven is efficient?</li>
        <li>How effective do you think the dials are on a toaster oven, and is it easy to understand and use?</li>
        <li>Which dial do you most frequently use and why?</li>
        <li>Given how the dials are displayed, have you ever been confused by which dial to use, or do you ever reach
           for the wrong dial? If so, how often in the past 2 weeks?</li>
        <li>How effective is representing time and heat in the circular fashion of a dial?</li>
        <li>Does seeing the whole range of increments of time and heat help you in using this toaster oven? Would you prefer 
          to see these increments represented with a different visual design (linear scale, keypad)?</li>
        <li>How many times in the past 2 weeks have you turned the dial inaccurately (not achieving the result you want)?</li>
        <li>Can you suggest some improvements for this toaster, and what other functions would you want this toaster to have?</li>
      </ol>

      <p class = "paragraph">This storyboard is written for Practical Peggy, and shows how she uses the toaster oven for dinner. After coming home from a tiring day from work, Peggy uses the toaster oven to quickly make pizzas and buffalo wings for her family. She can easily control the toaster to make these simple recipes, so the toaster is a practical and efficient solution to her dinner challenges. </p>
